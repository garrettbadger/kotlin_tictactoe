This repository cotains a simple tictactoe program written in the Kotlin language. I created this program to help myself learn more about the Kotlin language. I have always enjoyed mobile apps and their convenience and by learning Kotlin I hope to be able to create my own app some day.

This program demonstrates the basics of the language. It uses things like mutable and immutable variables, it shows functions, classes, conditional expressions, and loops.

This video contains a brief overview of my project and the reason why I decided to create it.

# Development Environment

IntelliJ Idea IDE v.2021.3.1

openjdk-17.0.1

# Useful Websites


* [Kotlin Language](https://kotlinlang.org/)

# Future Work

* I would love to add a gui of some sort to make the game playable outside of the console.
* Add options to play on a bigger board with an increased number of tiles in a row to win.
* Allow the user to choose what their character will be instead of just X and O.

# Overview
This repository cotains a simple tictactoe program written in the Kotlin language.


This repository cotains a simple tictactoe program written in the Kotlin language. I created this program to help myself learn more about the Kotlin language. I have always enjoyed mobile apps and their convenience and by learning Kotlin I hope to be able to create my own app some day.

This program demonstrates the basics of the language. It uses things like mutable and immutable variables, it shows functions, classes, conditional expressions, and loops.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

* I would love to add a gui of some sort to make the game playable outside of the console.
* Add options to play on a bigger board with an increased number of tiles in a row to win.
* Allow the user to choose what their character will be instead of just X and O.
